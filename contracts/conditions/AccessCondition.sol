/**
 * @title Access Condition
 * @author Nevermined
 *
 * @dev Implementation of the Access Condition
 *
 *      Access Secret Store Condition is special condition
 *      where a client or Parity secret store can encrypt/decrypt documents 
 *      based on the on-chain granted permissions. For a given DID 
 *      document, and agreement ID, the owner/provider of the DID 
 *      will fulfill the condition. Consequently secret store 
 *      will check whether the permission is granted for the consumer
 *      in order to encrypt/decrypt the document.
