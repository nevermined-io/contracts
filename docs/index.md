## AccessProofCondition

_Implementation of the Access Condition with transfer proof.
The idea is that the hash of the decryption key is known before hand, and the key matching this hash
is passed from data provider to the buyer using this smart contract. Using ZK proof the key is kept
hidden from outsiders. For the protocol to work, both the provider and buyer need to have public keys
in the babyjub curve. To initiate the deal, buyer will pass the key hash and the public keys of participants.
The provider needs to pass the cipher text encrypted using MIMC (symmetric encryption). The secret key for MIMC
is computed using ECDH (requires one public key and one secret key for the curve). The hash function that is
used is Poseidon._

_Implementation of the Condition

     Each condition has a validation function that returns either FULFILLED, 
     ABORTED or UNFULFILLED. When a condition is successfully solved, we call 
     it FULFILLED. If a condition cannot be FULFILLED anymore due to a timeout 
     or other types of counter-proofs, the condition is ABORTED. UNFULFILLED 
     values imply that a condition has not been provably FULFILLED or ABORTED.

transaction ordering. One possible solution to mitigate this race
condition is to first reduce the spender's allowance to 0 and set the
desired value afterwards:

## Address

### isContract

```solidity
function isContract(address account) internal view returns (bool)

_Returns true if `account` is a contract.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is unsafe to assume that an address for which this function returns
false is an externally-owned account (EOA) and not a contract.

Among others, `isContract` will return false for the following
types of addresses:

 - an externally-owned account
 - a contract in construction
 - an address where a contract will be created
 - an address where a contract lived, but was destroyed
====_

### sendValue

```solidity
function sendValue(address payable recipient, uint256 amount) internal
```

_Replacement for Solidity's `transfer`: sends `amount` wei to
`recipient`, forwarding all available gas and reverting on errors.

https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884[EIP1884] increases the gas cost
of certain opcodes, possibly making contracts go over the 2300 gas limit
imposed by `transfer`, making them unable to receive funds via
`transfer`. {sendValue} removes this limitation.

https://diligence.consensys.net/posts/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/[Learn more].

IMPORTANT: because control is transferred to `recipient`, care must be
taken to not create reentrancy vulnerabilities. Consider using
{ReentrancyGuard} or the
https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.11/security-considerations.html#use-the-checks-effects-interactions-pattern[checks-effects-interactions pattern]._

## SafeERC20

_Wrappers around ERC20 operations that throw on failure (when the token
contract returns false). Tokens that return no value (and instead revert or
throw on failure) are also supported, non-reverting calls are assumed to be

which allows you to call the safe operations as `token.safeTransfer(...)`, etc._

## AccessTemplate

_Implementation of Access Agreement Template

     Access template is use case specific template.
     Anyone (consumer/provider/publisher) can use this template in order
     to setup an on-chain SEA. The template is a composite of three basic
     conditions. Once the agreement is created, the consumer will lock an amount
     of tokens (as listed in the DID document - off-chain metadata) to the 
     the lock reward contract which in turn will fire an event. ON the other hand 
     the provider is listening to all the emitted events, the provider 
     will catch the event and grant permissions to the consumer through 
     secret store contract, the consumer now is able to download the data set
     by asking the off-chain component of secret store to decrypt the DID and 
     encrypt it using the consumer's public key. Then the secret store will 
     provide an on-chain proof that the consumer had access to the data set.
     Finally, the provider can call the escrow reward condition in order 
     to release the payment. Every condition has a time window (time lock and 
     time out). This implies that if the provider didn't grant the access to 
     the consumer through secret store within this time window, the consumer 
     can ask for refund._
