## Get Started

For local development of `nevermined-contracts` you can either use Docker, or setup the development environment on your machine.

### Docker

The simplest way to get started with is using the [Nevermined Tools](https://github.com/nevermined-io/tools),
a docker compose application to run all the Nevermined stack.

### Public Network development

For deploying in a public network check [ReleaseProcess.md](./docs/ReleaseProcess.md) first.

### Local development

As a pre-requisite, you need:

* Node.js
* yarn

Clone the project and install all dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nevermined-io/contracts.git
cd contracts/
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Compile the solidity contracts:

```bash
yarn compile
```

In a new terminal, launch an Ethereum RPC client, e.g. hardhat:

```bash
npx hardhat node --port 18545
```

Switch back to your other terminal and deploy the contracts:

```bash
yarn deploy:external
```

For redeployment run this instead

```bash
yarn clean
yarn compile
yarn deploy:external
```

Upgrade contracts [**optional**]:

```bash
yarn upgrade:external
```

## Testing

Run tests with `yarn test`, e.g.:

```bash
yarn test test/unit/agreements/AgreementStoreManager.Test.js
```

### Code Linting

Linting is setup for `JavaScript` with [ESLint](https://eslint.org) & Solidity with [Ethlint](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Ethlint).

Code style is enforced through the CI test process, builds will fail if there're any linting errors.

```bash
yarn lint
```

## Networks

When Nevermined contracts are deployed into different networks, the ABIs referring to the specific
version deployed are copied into the [Artifacts repository](https://artifacts.nevermined.network/).

You can find more information about the this into the [Release Process documentation](docs/ReleaseProcess.md).

For contracts older to v3.x please see the [Legacy Artifacts Repository](https://artifacts.nevermined.rocks/).

## Documentation

* [Contracts Documentation](doc/contracts/README.md)
* [Release process](doc/RELEASE_PROCESS.md)
* [Packaging of libraries](doc/PACKAGING.md)
* [Upgrading of contracts](doc/UPGRADES.md)
* [Template lifecycle](doc/TEMPLATE_LIFE_CYCLE.md)

## Prior Art

This project builds on top of the work done in open source projects:

* [zeppelinos/zos](https://github.com/zeppelinos/zos)
* [OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-eth](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-eth)
